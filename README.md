# Funny CI/CD Test Site

Tiny, static, and ready for pipeline demos.

## What it is
- One HTML page with a DevOps/Jenkins joke.
- CSS for a friendly, mobile-first layout.
- A button that pops a JavaScript alert (no backend).

## How to use
1. Serve or open `index.html` in any browser.
2. Wire it into your CI/CD to prove deploys work.
3. Click the button to confirm JS is alive.

## Why it is demo-friendly
- Zero dependencies or build steps.
- Loads instantly and cacheable anywhere.
- Safe to host publicly—no secrets or calls.

## Files
- `index.html` — page content and JS alert.
- `style.css` — layout and theming.
- `README.md` — project overview.
